# What Hardware Do I Need

## Computer

You need a computer that runs Windows, macOS, or Linux (64-bit x86_64). You will need a gamepad that can connect to the computer (Logitech F310 gamepad<sup>&ast;</sup> works well). Said computer must have a WiFi adapter (a USB one works).


<sup>&ast;</sup>Instead of using a gamepad with the Drive Station software on your PC you could use the Android Drive Station app, which makes use of a virtual touchscreen gamepad.
