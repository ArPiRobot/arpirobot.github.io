#### **ArPiRobot Updates**
Updates can be downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/MB3hel/ArPiRobot-UpdatePackager/releases). 

There are two update zips for each update: A robot update zip (to be installed on the robot with the Deploy Tool) and a development update (to be installed on the development computer using the containd installer scripts).

#### **Drive Station**
The Drive Station can be downloaded form [GitHub](https://github.com/MB3hel/ArPiRobot-DriveStation/releases).

Each release has three files: A windows installer (.exe), a macOS package (.zip), and a universal Java archive (.jar). The Windows installers and macOS packages install Java with the Drive Station, however if you are using the JAR (usually on Linux or *BSD), it is necessary to also install Java (11 or newer). It is recommended to use distribution packages for Linux and BSDs. If using the JAR on macOS or Windows, it is recommended to use [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) packages.
