## Where to Buy Components

*Note: These are not the only possible places to buy components. These are just general recommendations.*

[Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/) - Sell many custom microcontroller boards and sensor / motor controller breakout boards. Also sell Raspberry Pi computers and various components such as motors. 

[Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/) - Similar to Adafruit, sell many custom sensor / motor controller boards. Sell Arduinos and custom microcontroller boards as well as Raspberry Pi computers, motors, and various other components.

[Digikey](https://www.digikey.com/) - Sell various electronic chips and components. Also stock most / all Adafruit parts (and usually allow back ordering).

[Mouser](https://www.mouser.com/) -  Sell various electronic chips and components. Also stock many Adafruit parts (and usually allow back ordering).

[Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/) - Good source for "common" parts being used. Sometimes motors and some sensor boards can be found. Mostly good for "generic" type parts and common parts.

[Banggood](https://www.banggood.com/) - Stocks many items to be purchased online. Similar to Amazon, but slow shipping from China. Sometimes cheaper prices than Amazon and sometimes slightly different availability.

[DFRobot](https://www.dfrobot.com/) - Provide many robot kits and components. The kits often include electronics that are not easily usable with the ArPiRobot framework, but the robot chases can be useful. Additionally, some sensors and motors are useful.

[Robotshop](https://www.robotshop.com/) - Stock many components, including many DFRobot motors with cheaper shipping.

[Arduino Store](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/) - This is sometimes the only place to easily find some Arduino boards.


## Mechanical Components

### Base / Frame / Chassis

*Sometimes, kits are used for the robot's base / frame / chassis, however this is also frequently custom built. Some kits are linked here. This is not a complete list of kits.*

    | Chassis Kit    | Description                                             | Link(s)           |
    | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
    | Generic 2WD Acrylic | This is a simple chassis cut out of acrylic. It is semi-decent quality (for acrylic), however acrylic will crack over time. Additionally, the space for electrical components is relatively small. This is decent for a low cost, simple build with relatively few sensors, but won't scale well to more complex robots. Often comes as a kit including motors, wheels, a AA battery pack, and mounting hardware. | [Amazon Source 1](https://www.amazon.com/perseids-Chassis-Encoder-Wheels-Battery/dp/B07DNYQ3PX/) <br /> [Amazon Source 2](https://www.amazon.com/Smart-Chassis-Motors-Encoder-Battery/dp/B01LXY7CM3/) <br /> [Amazon Source 3](https://www.amazon.com/YIKESHU-Smart-Chassis-Encoder-Battery/dp/B073VHQT6P/) |
    | Generic 4WD Acrylic | This is a simple chassis cut out of acrylic. It is semi-decent quality (for acrylic), however acrylic will crack over time. the two layers allow a little extra space for electrical components compared to the 2WD kit linked above, however space is still limited. Often comes as a kit including motors, wheels, a battery pack, and mounting hardware. However, usually comes with a 4x AA battery pack, which is barely sufficient for a 4WD robot. 5 AA batteries are highly recommended instead. There are also variations that include mecanum wheels. | [Amazon Source 1](https://www.amazon.com/perseids-Chassis-Encoder-Wheels-Battery/dp/B07DNXBFQN/) <br /> [Amazon Source 2](https://www.amazon.com/MakerFocus-Chassis-MEGA2560-MEGA1280-Microcontroller/dp/B01LYZDP9U/) <br /> [Amazon Source 3](https://www.amazon.com/Mixse-Smart-Robot-car-Raspberry/dp/B07412K5RP/) <br /> [Amazon Source 4](https://www.amazon.com/YIKESHU-Smart-Chassis-Encoder-Battery/dp/B075LD4FPN/) <br /> [Banggood Source 1](https://www.banggood.com/4WD-Smart-Robot-Chassis-Car-DIY-Kits-With-Magneto-Speed-Encoder-For-Arduino-51-p-1145101.html) <br /> [Banggood Source 2](https://www.banggood.com/DIY-4WD-Double-Deck-Smart-Robot-Car-Chassis-Kits-with-Speed-Encoder-p-1311469.html) | 
    | DFRobot 4WD (Pirate) | Good quality Aluminum robot chassis including 4 motors. Motors included are a 1:120 gear ratio as opposed to the more common 1:48 gear ratio. Provides ample space for electrical components, but not much space for more complex mechanical systems. | [DFRobot Shop](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-97.html) <br />  |
